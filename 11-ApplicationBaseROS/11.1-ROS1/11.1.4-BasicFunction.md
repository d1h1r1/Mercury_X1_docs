## Mercury X1 Controls

Here we mainly introduce how to control the movement of Mercury X1 through a series of related instructions.

### 1. Chassis underlying communication

First, start the underlying communication and map construction program of the chassis.
Open the ROS1 environment terminal and run the command:

```bash
roslaunch turn_on_mercury_robot mapping.launch
```

### 2. Load URDF model

After the underlying communication program is started, the Mercury X1 URDF model is loaded through the launch file, a ROS1 environment terminal is opened, and then the command is run.

```bash
roslaunch turn_on_mercury_robot slider_control.launch
```

You can then control the movement of the joint model in rviz by dragging the slider.

### 3.Joint control

After the URDF model is successfully loaded, if you want the real Mercury X1 to move along with it, you need to open another ROS1 environment terminal and run the command:

Then run the command:

```bash
rosrun turn_on_mercury_robot slider_control.py
```

**Please note: Since the robot arm will move to the current position of the model when the command is entered, please make sure that the model in rviz does not have mold penetration before you use the command**
**Do not quickly drag the slider after connecting the robotic arm to prevent damage to the robotic arm**

### 4 Chassis Control

After the joint control program is started, if you want the chassis car in the real Mercury X1 to run together, you need to start the keyboard control program of the chassis car, open a ROS1 environment terminal, and then run the command:

```bash
rosrun turn_on_mercury_robot mercury_keyboard.py
```
