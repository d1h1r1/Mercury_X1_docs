* **Go to http://www.python.org/download/ to download Python.**
* **Click "Download" to start downloading. Check "Add Python 3.10 to PATH". Click "Install Now" to start the installation.**

### 1.2 Running Python
Open the Command Prompt window (Win+R, type "cmd" and press "Enter"). Type "Python".

**Successful Installation:**

<img src="../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/image/successfulinstallation.jpg" alt="7.1.1-1" style="zoom:50%;" />

This indication on the screen means that Python has been successfully installed. The prompt ">>>" indicates the Python interactive environment. If you enter a piece of Python code, you will get the execution result immediately.



**Error Report:**

If you enter an incorrect command, such as "pythonn", the system may report an error.

<img src="../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/image/installerror.jpg" alt="7.1.1-1" style="zoom:67%;" />

> **Note:** Generally, this error is caused by insufficient environment configuration. Refer to **1.3 Environment Configuration** to solve the problem.



### 1.3 Environment Variable Configuration
Windows follows the Path environment variable settings to search for **python.exe**. Otherwise, an error will be reported. If you did not check "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" during installation, you need to manually add the path where python.exe is located to the environment variables or re-download Python. Remember to check "Add Python 3.9 to PATH".

Follow these steps to manually add Python to the environment variables.

* Right-click the "My Computer" icon --> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables

<img src="../../resources/6-SDKDevelopment/image/environment configuration.jpg" alt="7.1.1-1" style="zoom:50%;" />

* Environment variables include user variables and system variables. For user variables, users can use their downloaded programs through the "cmd" command. Write the absolute path of the target program into the user variables.

* After configuration is complete, open the Command Prompt window (Win+R; type "cmd" and press "Enter"), then type "Python".
