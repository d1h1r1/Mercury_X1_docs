Welcome to the world of Elephant Robotics Mercury series - where innovation and practicality intertwine to provide an unprecedented universal hardware platform for embodied intelligence and humanoid robot research. We are proud to present three unique product models, each with its excellent features to meet your diverse needs in the field of robotics research and education.

&emsp;&emsp;Mercury X1 wheeled humanoid robot: The whole machine has a total of 19 degrees of freedom. It combines a high-performance mobile base with advanced dual-arm coordination and perception capabilities, equipped with NVIDIA Jetson edge computing core, and 3D machine vision, providing powerful computing power and hardware foundation for robotics and embodied intelligence research and development.

&emsp;&emsp;Mercury B1 semi-humanoid robot, with 17 degrees of freedom and dual seven-axis robotic arms, equipped with NVIDIA Jetson edge computing core, 3D machine vision, and voice interaction capabilities, is the first choice for human-computer interaction research and dual-arm collaborative control research.

&emsp;&emsp;Mercury A1 7-axis robot arm: ideal for educators, this lightweight harmonic joint robot arm with 7 degrees of freedom has a payload of 1kg, and the touch-sensitive quick control interface and application software greatly simplify application deployment without complex programming.

The Mercury series is not only a master of robotics technology, but also a partner in promoting scientific exploration and educational innovation.
